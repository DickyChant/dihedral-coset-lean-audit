## Status of Lemmas 1, 3, and 4

**Bottom line:** this development does not refute the final statement of any of
Lemmas 1, 3, or 4.  All three conclusions remain unproved.  What it does refute
are specific intermediate claims and inference rules on which the paper's proof
sketches rely.  Those refutations show that the published sketches do not prove
the lemmas, even though a different proof might conceivably establish some of
their conclusions.

| Lemma | Status of the final statement | Refutation and repair status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lemma 1 | Unproved, not refuted | The proposed low-part swap is invalid. An exact matching criterion and a fibre-preserving full-sample permutation are proved, but no plan preserving the Step-4 interference classes is known. |
| Lemma 3 | Unproved, not refuted | The phases are not pairwise independent after the adaptive choice of `A`. |
| Lemma 4 | Unproved, not refuted | The exponent, `mu`, and `n^(3/2)` bookkeeping errors are repaired. Conditional independence, correlated overflow, and multiplicative amplitude control remain unresolved. |

### Lemma 1

The Lean development proves that the change caused by the paper's simultaneous
swap of selection bits and low sample parts is

```text
B * (phi_j - phi_i) * (H_i - H_j).
```

This expression need not vanish modulo the measured subset-sum modulus.  A
locally valid `n = 8` instance changes the relevant contribution from `1` to
`5` modulo `128`.  Thus the proposed map does not preserve a measured fibre;
see [`SwapFiber.lean`](SimonDCP/Arithmetic/SwapFiber.lean).

The concrete `n = 8` witness is not a full member of the paper's event `D_Y`,
because that event imposes additional global distinctness conditions.  More
importantly, failure of this particular injection does not logically imply
that Lemma 1's constant-probability conclusion is false.  The injection argument
is refuted; the lemma statement remains unproved.

[`SwapFiberRepair.lean`](SimonDCP/Arithmetic/SwapFiberRepair.lean) proves the
exact repair criterion: for a zero/one swap with measured modulus
`B * stride`, the original low-part operation is valid exactly when
`stride` divides `H_i - H_j`.  It also proves that permuting each complete
Fourier sample together with its selection and Hadamard-output coordinates is
a bijection preserving the subset sum, every measured residue fibre, the phase
exponent, and sample distinctness.

This repairs the algebraic map, but not yet the whole Lemma 1 injection.  After
Step 4, terms with equal `(h, s_1, ..., s_g)` labels interfere.  A complete
repair must construct a reversible bad-to-good permutation chosen only from
the measured outcome and carry every such interference class through one fixed
label equivalence.  The Lean module packages these requirements as an explicit
`LemmaOneRepairCertificate`; this is only a structural interface.  Even an
instance would still need to descend to an injective map on measured `(Y, D)`
outcomes and prove that their probability weights do not decrease.  The
separate `MeasuredOutcomeWeightInjectionCertificate` states exactly that
remaining finite weighted-injection obligation, and Lean proves that any such
certificate implies total bad-event weight at most total good-event weight; no
instance is assumed.

### Lemma 3

Step 4 selects `A` from blocks on which the measured mask `D` is zero.  Hence
`D_A = 0`, and

```text
(-1)^(phi dot D) = (-1)^(phi_B dot D_B).
```

States with the same `B` component and different `A` components therefore have
identical phases.  They are perfectly correlated rather than pairwise
independent, contrary to the variance argument in the proof sketch; see
[`PhaseCorrelation.lean`](SimonDCP/Quantum/PhaseCorrelation.lean).

This directly refutes the claimed phase-independence step.  It does not yet give
a complete instance of the paper's conditioned experiment that violates the
final "well-behaved" probability statement, so Lemma 3 itself remains unproved
rather than refuted.

### Lemma 4

The development gives finite counterexamples to three inference patterns used
in or around the proof:

- independent Boolean coordinates can become perfectly correlated after
  conditioning;
- adding a correlated overflow bit can turn a balanced bit into a constant;
- nearly equal counts of signed terms give no multiplicative control of an
  amplitude when cancellation is possible.

See [`Conditioning.lean`](SimonDCP/Probability/Conditioning.lean) and
[`AmplitudeCancellation.lean`](SimonDCP/Quantum/AmplitudeCancellation.lean).

The page-14 exponent does admit a local repair.  The standard-deviation
exponent already contains `-n`, so multiplication by `kappa' = 2^n` must cancel
that term.  The printed calculation instead retains an extra `+n`.  Correcting
it changes the total exponent at `c = 12` from

```text
-n/2 + 6n/(c' log n) + 6 log n,
```

to

```text
-3n/2 + 6n/(c' log n) + 6 log n.
```

Consequently the desired exponent is at most `-n` under the explicit budget
`12n/(c' log n) + 12 log n <= n`.  The same module proves that the amplitude
sum factors out the mean bin multiplicity `mu`, not the total `|A_(g_a)|`, and
that retaining the actual `n^(3/2)` bound gives polynomial exponent `-2` at
`c = 12`.  These repairs are in
[`Lemma4Parameters.lean`](SimonDCP/Probability/Lemma4Parameters.lean).

Even without correcting the extra `+n`, the printed exponent at `c = 12` is
`-n/2 + o(n)`.  If this were first established as a simultaneous absolute
error bound on normalized amplitudes, it would absorb every downstream
polynomial factor.  Thus the exponent typo is repairable and is not the
decisive obstruction to Lemma 4.

The repaired arithmetic does not establish the conditional balls-in-bins
premises or overcome signed-amplitude cancellation.  The final
multiplicative-amplitude conclusion of Lemma 4 therefore remains unproved, not
refuted.  The detailed audit is in [`AUDIT.md`](AUDIT.md).

## Project scope

This Lean 4 project formalizes and audits Daniel R. Simon's preliminary draft
[*A Polynomial-Time Quantum Algorithm for the Dihedral Coset Problem*](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/1591)
(IACR ePrint 2026/1591).

The draft's headline theorem is not currently represented as a proved Lean
theorem. Its proof relies on several false or unproved intermediate claims. The
development therefore starts with the sound algebraic kernel and kernel-checkable
obstructions to the invalid proof steps. It does not use `sorry` or hide gaps as
axioms.

## Formalization map

- `Quantum/IdealCosetSample.lean` defines the normalized ideal DCP sample in
  QuantumAlg and proves its exact two-point Born distribution.
- `Quantum/FourierShift.lean` proves the corresponding `ZMod` DFT translation
  and relative-phase identities using Mathlib's exact sign convention.
- `Quantum/Step2Phase.lean` proves the root-of-unity factorization that exposes
  the least significant bit of the hidden shift.
- `Arithmetic/TranslationFiber.lean` proves the valid high-bit translation
  argument underlying Lemma 2.
- `Quantum/PhaseTransfer.lean` proves the measured-XOR phase transfer used at
  the end of the proposed algorithm.
- `Quantum/BitReadout.lean` proves that one Hadamard gate reads an exact
  `(-1)^bit` relative phase with probability one.
- `Quantum/ConditionalReadout.lean` packages the final result under the exact
  balanced-amplitude premise that the paper would still need to prove.
- `Quantum/PhaseCorrelation.lean`, `Probability/Conditioning.lean`, and
  `Quantum/AmplitudeCancellation.lean` isolate the failures in Lemmas 3 and 4.
- `Probability/LinearPhaseIndependence.lean` proves the correct unconditioned
  joint-uniformity theorem for distinct nonzero binary linear forms.
- `Arithmetic/SampleRecursion.lean` proves the arithmetic of deleting a known
  low bit and halving an ideal DCP sample.
- `Arithmetic/SwapFiber.lean` gives an `n = 8` locally valid two-coordinate
  counterexample to the fibre-preserving algebra used in Lemma 1, together
  with the general error formula.
- `Arithmetic/SwapFiberRepair.lean` proves the exact matching condition, the
  complete-coordinate permutation identity, and partial certificate interfaces
  for the still-missing Step-4 interference and measured-weight arguments.
- `Probability/Lemma4Parameters.lean` repairs the page-14 exponent arithmetic,
  distinguishes `mu` from total cardinality, and propagates the stated
  `n^(3/2)` amplitude bound.

The project deliberately separates these formalized local facts from the missing
adaptive-measurement, probability, postselection, amplification, and lattice-
reduction arguments needed for the headline result.

## Toolchain

- Lean 4.31.0
- Mathlib 4.31.0
- CSLib 4.31.0
- `QudeLeap/Lean-QuantumAlg` at commit
  `7e80846034b9e76fdeded711775a513a7d5ba917`

The project is intended to be built in Arch Linux under WSL:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Users/yanyx/Documents/Simon
bash scripts/setup-wsl-arch.sh
bash scripts/build-wsl.sh
```

The same build can be launched from PowerShell with:

```powershell
wsl.exe -d archlinux -- bash -lc 'cd /mnt/c/Users/yanyx/Documents/Simon && bash scripts/build-wsl.sh'
```

The checked environment uses Elan 4.2.3 and Lean 4.31.0.  For faster builds on
Windows-mounted drives, copy the repository to a WSL-native directory before
running `scripts/build-wsl.sh`; the source tree remains authoritative.

The full project, including both repair modules, was verified in Arch Linux
under WSL on August 7, 2026.  The command `lake build` completed all 3280 jobs
successfully.

## Verification policy

Every theorem in the project must compile without `sorry`. Missing arguments
from the paper are recorded as named obligations or refuted by explicit
counterexamples; they are never silently promoted to assumptions. Final claims
are checked with `#print axioms`.  The audit reports only the standard Lean
dependencies `propext`, `Classical.choice`, and `Quot.sound`; it reports no
`sorryAx` or project-local axiom.

See [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md) for the proof-status map and
[LIBRARIES.md](LIBRARIES.md) for the TCS/quantum-library survey.
