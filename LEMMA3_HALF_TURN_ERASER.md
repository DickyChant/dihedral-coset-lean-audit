# A global half-turn primitive as a possible Lemma 3 repair

Reference: [IACR ePrint 2026/1591](https://eprint.iacr.org/2026/1591)

## Status

This note investigates a genuinely different replacement for the local
grouping and first-zero decoder used after Step 2.  The proposed primitive is
information-theoretically well defined, and an exact signed-frame formula
identifies its polar part.  No polynomial-time implementation is currently
known or supplied here.  Conversely, this note does **not** prove that a
polynomial implementation is impossible: a direct two-outcome half-turn test
may be weaker than coherent preparation of an entire subset-sum fibre.

The conclusion is therefore a research boundary, not a repaired theorem:

- the desired operation exists as a partial isometry on the occupied
  fibre-uniform subspace;
- generic postselection, amplitude amplification, and polar-decomposition
  implementations cost about `sqrt(N) = 2^(n/2)`;
- the most explicit direct candidate is a signed sum of product-state frame
  projectors, but its natural implementation has the same cancellation and
  normalization barrier;
- obtaining polynomial time would require a new average-case subset-sum
  sampling or direct-measurement idea.

## Fibre formulation

Let

```text
N = 2^n,
H = N/2,
f_Y(x) = sum_i x_i * Y_i mod N,
F_t = {x : f_Y(x) = t},
eta_t = |F_t|.
```

For every nonempty fibre define its normalized state

```text
|F_t> = eta_t^(-1/2) * sum_(x in F_t) |x>.
```

The top bit of `t` distinguishes the pair `t` and `t+H`, while the residue
`t mod H` is common.  An ideal `HalfTurnEraser` would act on the occupied
fibre-uniform subspace as

```text
|F_t>     -> |t mod H> |0> |garbage_(t mod H)>,
|F_(t+H)> -> |t mod H> |1> |garbage_(t mod H)>.
```

The same garbage on both halves is essential.  If the input carries relative
phase `(-1)^d`, a final Hadamard on the half bit recovers `d`.  If the two
fibre weights are not exactly equal, the normalized two-branch state is

```text
(sqrt(eta_t) |0> + (-1)^d sqrt(eta_(t+H)) |1>)
/ sqrt(eta_t + eta_(t+H)),
```

and the wrong-bit probability is exactly

```text
(sqrt(eta_t) - sqrt(eta_(t+H)))^2
/ (2 * (eta_t + eta_(t+H))).
```

Thus concentration of random high-density subset-sum fibre sizes would make
the information-theoretic decoder accurate.  It does not by itself provide a
circuit for erasing the path index.

## Exact partial isometry

Define the incidence map

```text
J_Y |x> = |f_Y(x)>.
```

Then

```text
J_Y |F_t> = sqrt(eta_t) |t>.
```

The polar partial isometry of `J_Y` therefore maps `|F_t>` exactly to `|t>` on
the row space.  Relabelling `t` as `(t mod H, highBit(t))` gives an exact
information-theoretic `HalfTurnEraser`.  Equivalently, if clean controlled
preparation circuits

```text
U_(Y,t) |0> = |F_t>
```

were available, applying their inverses branchwise would erase the fibre and
leave the half bit coherent.

This construction is an existence statement.  Implementing the polar
partial isometry, or implementing the controlled uniform fibre sampler, is
the computational problem.

## A concrete signed-frame candidate

Let `omega` be a primitive `N`-th root of unity and let `m` be the number of
Boolean variables in the selected subset-sum instance.  For `q in ZMod N`,
define the efficiently describable product state

```text
|psi_q> = 2^(-m/2) * sum_x omega^(q * f_Y(x)) |x>
        = tensor_i (|0> + omega^(q * Y_i) |1>) / sqrt(2).
```

Consider the signed frame operator

```text
K_Y = sum_(q in ZMod N) (-1)^q |psi_q><psi_q|.
```

Fourier orthogonality gives the exact identity

```text
K_Y |F_t>
  = (N / 2^m) * sqrt(eta_t * eta_(t+H)) * |F_(t+H)>.
```

Hence the polar part of `K_Y` is precisely the half-turn swap

```text
|F_t> <-> |F_(t+H)>
```

on every paired nonempty fibre.  When all fibre sizes are close to
`2^m/N`, the singular values of `K_Y` on the fibre-uniform subspace are close
to one.  This is the clearest positive structural candidate found in this
investigation: the desired global operation is already encoded by a signed
sum of simple product-state projectors.

There is also an exact normalized formula that does not require balanced
fibres.  Let

```text
P_Y = sum_q |psi_q><psi_q|.
```

On the normalized fibre basis put `p_t = N*eta_t/2^m`.  Then

```text
P_Y = sum_t p_t |F_t><F_t|,
K_Y = sum_t sqrt(p_t*p_(t+H)) |F_(t+H)><F_t|.
```

Consequently, on the support where both paired fibres are nonempty,

```text
T_Y = P_Y^(-1/2) K_Y P_Y^(-1/2)
    = sum_t |F_(t+H)><F_t|
```

is the exact half-turn swap.  The ideal two-outcome test is the projective
measurement with effects `(Pi + T_Y)/2` and `(Pi - T_Y)/2`, where `Pi` is the
support projector.  Fibre balance is needed only to replace the normalized
operator `T_Y` by the raw signed frame `K_Y`; it is not needed for this exact
identity.

The obstacle is implementation rather than algebra.  The signed sum contains
`N` terms and obtains its useful action through exponential cancellation.
The natural LCU or block-encoding normalization is of order `N`; merely
knowing that the final operator is almost unitary on a special subspace does
not supply a circuit that realizes those cancellations at unit scale.

## Generic implementation costs

Several standard constructions all expose the same `sqrt(N)` scale.

1. Preparing a uniform Boolean superposition and postselecting one value of
   `f_Y` succeeds with probability approximately `1/N`.  Generic amplitude
   amplification therefore takes `Theta(sqrt(N))` uses of the subset-sum
   oracle.
2. Preparing the pair `{t,t+H}` only doubles that probability and does not
   change the exponential scale.
3. A natural block encoding of the incidence or signed-frame operator has
   singular-value/normalization scale about `N^(-1/2)`.  Generic QSVT or polar
   transformation again needs degree of order `sqrt(N)`.
4. Coherent pretty-good-measurement implementations require the same
   inverse-square-root frame operation.  A clean uniform fibre sampler would
   solve it, but constructing that sampler is exactly the missing primitive.
5. Hashing a large fibre down to unique or polynomial-size buckets removes
   the multiplicity only by adding about `n` constraints.  The remaining
   inversion problem has density near one and generic search again costs
   `Theta(sqrt(N))`.

These are barriers for the standard oracle and block-encoding routes, not an
unconditional circuit lower bound for random arithmetic subset sum.

The block-encoding statement can be made precise in the natural
product-preparation oracle model.  Controlled preparation of
`|q>|psi_q>` followed by projection of `q` onto the uniform state encodes the
analysis/synthesis map divided by `sqrt(N)`.  For balanced random fibres the
unscaled nonzero singular values are of constant order, hence the encoded
ones are of order `1/sqrt(N)`.  Generic singular-value amplification or polar
QSVT therefore uses `Theta(sqrt(N))` oracle calls.  This is a lower bound for
that PREP-only implementation model, not for circuits allowed to exploit the
explicit modular arithmetic of the `Y_i` in some new way.

## A weaker target: `HalfTurnTest`

Full coherent erasure is stronger than necessary.  It would suffice to
implement the two-outcome measurement whose relevant vectors are

```text
(|F_t> + |F_(t+H)>) / sqrt(2),
(|F_t> - |F_(t+H)>) / sqrt(2).
```

This is the one-bit version of the subset-sum pretty-good measurement studied
by Bacon, Childs, and van Dam.  Their analysis shows that the information-
theoretic one-bit measurement has the same density threshold as the full
optimal DCP measurement, and connects restricted efficient implementation to
quantum sampling of subset-sum solutions.  In particular, a uniform fibre
sampler implements the test.  The reverse implication is not established in
the unrestricted circuit model, so a direct `HalfTurnTest` leaves a genuine
logical opening.

The signed-frame operator `K_Y` is currently the most concrete direct route to
such a test.  No implementation that exploits its tensor-product summands
while avoiding the `sqrt(N)` cancellation cost has been found.

An equivalent direct formulation isolates the precise missing operation.
Define the normalized synthesis map

```text
B_Y = (1/sqrt(N)) * sum_q |psi_q><q|.
```

If `B_Y = V_Y |B_Y|` is its polar decomposition, then on nonempty fibres
`V_Y` maps Fourier labels to the corresponding normalized fibre states.
Consequently the circuit

```text
apply V_Y^dagger; measure the parity of q
```

implements the ideal `HalfTurnTest` exactly.  This `ParityPGM` description is
strictly more direct than constructing and outputting a full classical fibre
sample.  It also shows why unequal fibre sizes are not the main problem: the
polar normalization removes them automatically.

In the balanced benchmark, the relevant singular values of `B_Y` are about
`1/sqrt(N)`.  Therefore a PREP/block-encoding/QSVT implementation of its polar
factor requires `Theta(sqrt(N))` calls, up to approximation logarithms.  This
same scale appears in a simple sampling lower bound for a narrower family of
algorithms.  On an ideal `+/-` fibre-pair input, a single rank-one projector
test against a sampled `|psi_q>` succeeds with probability at most `2/N`.
Even optimally importance-sampling the correct parity leaves second moment at
least `N/2`; a parity-symmetric sampler has second moment `N`.  Independent
classical trials thus need order `N`, while coherent amplification recovers
the order-`sqrt(N)` cost.  This rules out single-`q` projector sampling as a
polynomial implementation, not arbitrary collective arithmetic circuits.

There is an important distinction between two meanings of “weaker.”  A
distribution-specific procedure that consumes the natural DCP state and emits
one classical parity bit need not expose a reusable coherent fibre-pair
projector; no reduction from such a decoder to uniform fibre sampling is known
here.  That remains the genuine direct-decoder opening.  Even a clean reusable
`+/-` projective test supplies only the spectral projections of the half-turn
involution.  By itself it preserves all information within each paired-fibre
sector and does not construct `|F_t>` from a target label `t`.  Consequently
this investigation does **not** claim that the two-outcome test implies a
uniform fibre sampler.  The sampler-to-test direction is clear; the converse
is open and BCD's converse result concerns a more restricted implementation of
the complete measurement, not this bare two-outcome oracle.

## Why high density is not already a polynomial solution

For one selected group the paper uses `m = c*n` Boolean variables modulo an
`n`-bit modulus, so the subset-sum density is the constant `c`, not a growing
high-density regime.  Known results that solve certain medium-density random
instances in expected polynomial time require a much smaller modulus
bitlength, on the order of the square of the logarithm of the variable count;
that condition fails here.

More quantitatively, entering that proven polynomial regime for an `n`-bit
modulus would require at least `2^(Omega(sqrt(n)))` variables.  The paper has
only polynomially many samples, so increasing its fixed constant `c` does not
meet this condition.

Using all `Q = k*n^(c+1)` paper samples raises the density to about `n^c`, but
does not produce a known polynomial-time exact solver or coherent uniform
fibre sampler for an `n`-bit modulus.  Known high-density random modular
subset-sum methods instantiate here at subexponential, rather than
polynomial, cost.  Dynamic programming still has a state space of size `N`.

Moreover, finding one classical solution is insufficient.  A coherent eraser
needs nearly uniform amplitudes over a fibre, branch-independent clean
garbage, and a controlled inverse.  Reversible execution of a randomized
finder generally leaves the random seed and search path as which-path
garbage.

## Local-relation and fault-model cautions

A local signed toggle that changes the subset sum by `H` would satisfy

```text
sum_i sigma_i * Y_i = H mod N
```

on a small support.  For polynomially many random `Y_i`, the expected number
of such relations of support at most `C*log n` is bounded by

```text
sum_(r <= C*log n) binom(Q,r) * 2^r / N
  = 2^(-n + O(log^2 n)).
```

Thus a local quantum walk based on polynomially enumerable half-turn moves is
typically edgeless.  Relations begin only at support about
`n/log Q = Theta(n/log n)`; one fixed relation then applies to only a
`2^(-Theta(n/log n))` fraction of Boolean paths, so polynomially many such
moves do not cover a constant fraction of a fibre.

There is also a separate fault-support issue.  In a fixed classical fault
environment the faulty selection bits are fixed, so two paths that both lie in
the actual Step-2 affine-subcube support differ only on correct coordinates.
For such a supported pair, a half-turn of the full measured sum is also a
half-turn of the phase-relevant correct-coordinate sum because the common
faulty offset cancels.  The unresolved issue is implementation: a sampler or
pairing designed on the full Boolean cube may flip fixed faulty coordinates
and leave the actual affine-subcube support.  A valid primitive must preserve,
or coherently learn and respect, that unknown support decomposition; the
fault-free construction alone does not discharge this obligation.

## Relation to known DCP algorithms

The subset-sum connection is not accidental.  Bacon--Childs--van Dam identify
the pretty-good measurement and relate its restricted efficient
implementation to coherent sampling of subset-sum solution fibres:

- [Optimal measurements for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0501044)

Related work also supports treating exact coset/fibre unitaries as a
substantive algorithmic primitive rather than bookkeeping:

- [How Hard Is Deciding Trivial Versus Nontrivial in the Dihedral Coset Problem?](https://doi.org/10.4230/LIPIcs.TQC.2016.6)
- [Solving Medium-Density Subset Sum Problems in Expected Polynomial Time](https://crypto.ethz.ch/publications/FlaPrz05.html)
- [Random Modular Subset Sum](https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il/eccc-reports/2005/TR05-007/index.html)

There is a complete subexponential fallback for DCP: the Kuperberg/Regev
family of sieves runs in subexponential time, with variants trading time and
space.  These algorithms demonstrate that global phase collimation is
possible, but they do not give the polynomial-time repair sought here:

- [A Subexponential Time Algorithm for the Dihedral Hidden Subgroup Problem with Polynomial Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406151)
- [Another subexponential-time quantum algorithm for the dihedral hidden subgroup problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.3333)

## Current verdict and next research question

The ideal `HalfTurnEraser` is mathematically coherent, and `K_Y` gives an exact
operator formula whose polar part is the desired swap.  The missing step is a
polynomial implementation.  The investigation has not found one, and all
generic constructions encountered cost `2^(n/2)` up to polynomial factors.
This is not a no-go theorem: a direct two-outcome test could conceivably avoid
full fibre preparation.

The narrowest remaining positive question is therefore:

> Can the product-state representation of `K_Y` be used to implement its sign
> or polar action on the random fibre-uniform input ensemble, with
> inverse-polynomial success, without paying the natural `sqrt(N)` signed-sum
> normalization?

A positive answer would be a new DCP/subset-sum algorithmic ingredient.  A
negative answer would require a circuit-model or average-case lower bound that
is not presently available.
